## Spotify-Data-Analysis
**Project Overview**
 This project explores and analyzes Spotify's song and artist data to uncover trends in music
 characteristics, artist popularity, and track performance over time. Using Python and data
 visualization libraries, we transform raw Spotify datasets into insights that reveal how attributes like
 danceability, energy, acousticness, and tempo relate to popularity and artist success.
 
 **Dataset Description**
 The analysis uses two datasets:
 1. artists.csv – Contains metadata about Spotify artists (id, followers, genres, name, popularity).
 2. tracks.csv – Provides detailed audio features for each track (id, name, popularity, duration_ms,
 explicit, artists, danceability, energy, etc.).
 
 **Objectives** 
 Perform data cleaning and feature engineering.- Explore correlations between track features and popularity.- Identify top artists and songs.- Analyze music trends across genres and years.- Visualize distributions of features like danceability, tempo, and energy.
 
 **Key Insights**
 Tracks with moderate energy perform better.- Pop and Hip-hop dominate Spotify charts.- Danceable tracks correlate with user engagement.- Few artists drive majority of total streams.- Modern tracks are louder and faster on average.
 
 **Tools & Libraries Used**
 pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, Jupyter Notebook, re, datetime, json
 
 **Analysis Workflow**
 1. Data Import & Cleaning
 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 3. Visualization (Heatmaps, Top Artists, Trends)
 4. Feature Relationship Analysis

**How to Run**
 1. Clone repository
 git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Spotify-Data-Analysis.git
 2. Open notebook
 jupyter notebook spotify_data_analysis.ipynb
